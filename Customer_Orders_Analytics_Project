# In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data.
# Included were Customers, January Sales, February Sales tables as well as Column info about OrderIDs, AccountNumbers,
        Product, Quantity, price, orderdate, and location
# First project where we began working and cleaning "messy" data
      Primary filters for cleaning were "where length(orderID) = 6, and orderID <> 'Order ID';"

-- 1) Wanted a count of column and filtered out messy orderID data: # of orders in Jan 9681
select count(orderID) from BIT_DB.JanSales
where length(orderID) = 6
and orderID <> 'Order ID';

select * from BIT_DB.JanSales limit 5;

select Product from BIT_DB.JanSales
where Product = 'iPhone';


--2) How many of those orders were for iphone
select count(Product) from BIT_DB.JanSales
where Product = 'iPhone'
and length(orderID) = 6;
-- my query = 379 orders for iphone

SELECT COUNT(orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product='iPhone'
AND length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';
-- Course query = 379 orders for iphone

-- 3) Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February
select * from BIT_DB.customers;
select * from BIT_DB.FebSales;
--had to view messy data. will join on orderIDs. length=6

select acctnum from BIT_DB.customers customers
join BIT_DB.FebSales feb on customers.order_id = feb.orderID;
-- count = 1000 acct #s

select acctnum from BIT_DB.customers customers
join BIT_DB.FebSales feb on customers.order_id = feb.orderID
where length(feb.orderID) = 6;
-- My query also count = 1000 acct #s


SELECT distinct acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers cust
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
ON cust.order_id=FEB.orderid
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';
-- Course query and also count = 1000

select distinct acctnum from BIT_DB.customers customers
join BIT_DB.FebSales feb on customers.order_id = feb.orderID
where length(feb.orderID) = 6;



-- 4) Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
select * from BIT_DB.JanSales;
--get a view of our data

select min(price) from BIT_DB.JanSales;
-- 2.99 but we don't know what the product was

select distinct Product from BIT_DB.JanSales
where price = 2.99;
-- AAA Batteries (4Pack). My answer but elected to run multiple queries 

SELECT distinct Product, price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE price in (SELECT min(price) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales);
-- Course query. also AAA Batteries, 2.99. Chose a subquery to always have an outside query that would be up to date. more efficient.



-- 5) What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
-- (Revenue can be calculated using the number of products sold and the price of the products).
select count(distinct(Product)) from BIT_DB.JanSales;
-- 21 distinct products sold in January

select distinct product, round(sum(price)) from BIT_DB.JanSales
group by product;
-- thought abt it wrong. revenue is a product of qty and price

select product, sum(Quantity)*price as Revenue
from BIT_DB.JanSales
group by product;
-- Course answer, same results


--6) Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
select Product, sum(Quantity), sum(Quantity)*price as Revenue
from BIT_DB.FebSales
where location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101';
-- My answer. Product = Batteries, 2 sold, Revenue 7.68

SELECT
sum(Quantity),
product,
sum(quantity)*price as revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product;
-- Course answer, same results.


--7) How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
select count(acctnum) from BIT_DB.customers customers
join BIT_DB.FebSales feb
on customers.order_id=feb.orderID;

select acctnum from BIT_DB.customers;
-- 1000
select count(acctnum) from BIT_DB.customers;
-- 21,759
select count(distinct acctnum) from BIT_DB.customers;
-- 21,759
select * from BIT_DB.customers;
-- 1000 rows

select * from BIT_DB.FebSales
where Quantity > 2
and length(orderID) = 6;

select acctnum, price
from BIT_DB.customers customers
join BIT_DB.FebSales feb
on customers.order_id = feb.orderID
where Quantity > 2
and length(orderID) = 6;
--best shot rn

SELECT
count(distinct cust.acctnum),
avg(quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON FEB.orderid=cust.order_id
WHERE Feb.Quantity>2
AND length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';
-- Course Answer. Wanted 1 total number of customers and 1 total avg spent

select count(distinct acctnum), avg(Quantity*price) as AVG_Spent
from BIT_DB.customers customers
join BIT_DB.FebSales feb
on customers.order_id = feb.orderID
where Quantity > 2
and length(orderID) = 6
and orderID <> 'Order ID';
--Reworked how I would have coded the answer.

-- orderdates are not chronological. not ideal.

select location
from BIT_DB.FebSales

-- one result for a location that placed order at 1:35

select sum(Quantity)

-- 2 results for AA and AAA batteries

select distinct Product, Price
from BIT_DB.FebSales

-- List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold.
select Product, sum(Quantity)
from BIT_DB.FebSales
where location like '%Los Angeles%'
group by Product;
-- 19 distinct and grouped results for products and their qty sold in %LA%

SELECT Product, SUM(quantity)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location like '%Los Angeles%'
GROUP BY Product;
-- Course answer. same results.
